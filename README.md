# Minecraft-September-20th-2010-launcher
This is a very old version of the official Minecraft launcher I found using the WayBack Machine and extracted it using 7Zip.
It's from September 20th of 2010, and it's this probably as far back as I can go, because this is the oldest version of the official Minecraft launcher I could possibly find.
Feel free to fork/modify this however you so please, well that is if you so happen to have knowledge of how this shit works.
